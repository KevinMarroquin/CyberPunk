        <h2>CyberSecurity Beginnings</h2>
        <h3>1970s</h3>
        <p>
            CyberSecurity dates all the way back to the 1970s, with an interconnecting network called The Advanced Research Projects Agency Network.
            A man named Bob Thomas created the first virus named "Creeper", and it's function was to leave a message dislplaying "I'M THE CREEPER: CATCH ME IF YOU CAN".
            This would accure to people across the network. Eventually, someone by the name of Ray Tomlinson developed essentially the first anti virus called "Reaper" to combat the "Creeper".

        <h3>1980s</h3>
        <p>
        While computers began to progress in computing power, that also meant that probable viruses and hackings would also evolve. During the Cold war, the U.S aimed to create guidelines to protect from cyber attacks, creating "The Trusted Computer System Evalution Criteria" by the U.S Deepartment of Defence.
        A German named Marcus Hess, infultrated the U.S government systems at the Pentagon utilizing The Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) and planned on selling the information to the Russian KGB. The attack lead to security becoming the main focus on minigating risks of future infultration, thus creating the development
        of the cybersecurity industry in 1987. Many viruses began to emerge, and many security companies began development of anti virus software to the public, such as the VirusScan from McAfee. The Vienna virus was the first form of malware, and the Cascade virus was the first form of encrypted viruses. A student from Cornwell University named Robert T. Morris created
        a virus that negativily impacted the internet to the point of being finned by the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. It was one of the first widely publicized event in cybersecurity.

        <h3>1990s</h3>
        <p>
        The growth and develpment of the internet and cybersecurity grew at a rapid pace throughout the years. As viruses continue to evolve, companies face the challenge of developing software for newly made viruses. These viruses consist of the Macro; which had stealth capabilities, the "ILOVEYOU", and Melissa virus. Both these viruses targeted email services which caused slowdowns.
        Many viruses devloped with the goal of financial and data loss, which in result pressured cybersecurity companies to continue development of anti viruses.

        <h3><u>Fun Fact:</u></h3>
        <p>
        In 1995, Secure Socket Layer was developed to protect users with their online activity.

            <h3>2000s</h3>
        <p>
        At this point, the majority of the population in the U.S have personal computers and have an abundant access to the internet. The internet has grown exponentialy, but the likely hood of getting a virus became alot higher and dangerous. A hacker group called "The Albert Gonzales group" stole confidential information from millions of credit cards, Yahoo attacks hacked billions of peoples email accounts in 2013 to 2014. As a result, the CIA became more concerned and solutions were made to for the huge amount of hacks.
